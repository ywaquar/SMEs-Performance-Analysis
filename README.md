# SMEs-Performance-Analysis- PowerBI

## Problem Statements:
An EdTech company sends an excel file to all the SMEs every week where the performance, attendance, Shift hour, Number of questions answered, Average handling time, Answered Time, and other details of each employee are given. The salary for all the SMEs is based on the total answered time in a month. An employee works hard and solves more the question so that the answered time could increase. At the end of the month when he combines all 4 weeks of data and calculates the total answered time then he concludes that his total answered time is decreased from his actual answered time. He talks to his Team Leader and found that there is some glitch in the system by which his answer time was decreased. Then from the next week onwards, he worked in such a way that his answered time was increased from the actual answered time. So based on the weekly data he wants to analyze who is benefitting from this system glitch or who is getting lost.

## Task:
Consider yourself as an SME as well as Data Analyst, Now you have to figure out how much SMEs are getting benefitted from this glitch and how many SMEs are deducting their amount based on this data. Create a dashboard for the TL and SMEs as well by different criteria.
Create the comparison report based on the given data. Hence you need to represent the insights in a much better way so that you could target the TL and management so can bring attention to the management. Hence the dashboard should be self-explanatory and easy to understand so that management could fix this system glitch.

## Overview:

As I have only one week of data and base on this I am going to find out insights from this.

## Insights:

1) Based on this data the Average % of productivity for all the SMEs is above 60 %.
2) Average AHT is above 60 minutes.
3) Average Client Feedback Score (CFS) is above 65 %.
4) 25 SMEs got benefitted from this system glitch while 138 SMEs lost their salary.
5) Marketing Subject has the highest profit and minimum loss which means that the question might not be available on the portal for this week. Also, the productivity % is less than 20 %.
6) For 3 hour shift the average productivity is 77 % which is a concern for the company. The company should look for 3-hour shift SMEs.

Several other insights can also be seen from the dashboard.

## Conclusion:
if I could have several other weeks' data I would have combined all data and can do a comparison based on this data. As a data analyst and SME of the company, I would send this dashboard to the management and hope these insights will give attention to the management and can fix this system glitch.
